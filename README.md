# Files to recreate analyses from 'Using serially collected specimens to study the genomic consequences of decline in eastern woodland salamanders'

This repo contains all the scripts and inputs needed to recreate the analyses from the paper above, as well as the capture probe sequences.

You will find:
+ *scripts*: all code needed to create the paper from probe design to processing sequence data, calculating contamination read depth etc, as well as all estimates of genetic diversity.
+  *Final_Baits*: Fasta sequences of the target loci selected by the authors from reference transcriptome/genome and baits designed by Arbor Biosciences.
+  *vcfs*: Final vcf files used for various analyses and filtered in different ways. Names should be intuitive.
+  *sumstats_results_files*: STACKS Populations module outputs with summary statistics for each individual generated from the appropriate vcf file.

Feel free to reach out to the corresponding authors of the paper with more questions or clarification!
